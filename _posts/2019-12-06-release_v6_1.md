## Compatibility
It's a minor release so it's compatible with v6.0. You can simply replace the lvgl folder with the new version. 

You should update your `lv_conf.h` from `lv_conf_templ.h` to see the new config options.

## Main new features

### Bidirections support
Add support to Right-to-Left and mixed writing directions. Learn more [here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/overview/font.html#bidirectional-support).

### Subpixel rendering
Make font rendering on lower resolution displays smoother. Learn more [here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/overview/font.html#subpixel-rendering)

### Font compression
Store the bitmaps of the fonts in a compressed way. Learn more [here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/overview/font.html#compress-fonts).

### Higher quality fonts
The algorithm of the font converter is updated to produce better quality fonts.

### New symbols
The following symbols are added to the built fonts:
See all the symbols [here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/overview/font.html#built-in-fonts).

## Asserts in API functions
Add sanity check to the API functions. They can be configured in [lv_conf.h](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/blob/8bb67c0303e44315aa73348ce4f15b3204f4863e/lv_conf_template.h#L243-L277). You can use a different configuration for development and for production.

### Color picker object
